repo for challenge 20

This challenge asked me to build a smart contract capable of creating joint bank accounts for financial company customers. The contract has to be accessable by two accounts & money has to be able to be deposited & withdrawn. So I must first build the contract then interact, compile, & deploy it to test its usability. 

So to build the contract I created a contract name joinSavings with two variables for the accounts & then two more for last to withdraw & account balance. Then defined two functions - withdraw & deposit. 

I then compiled & deployed the contract on remix IDE. I interacted with it, testing - here are the results: - <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-08-21 at 8 48 30 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98225311/185819211-1fe482d9-2214-4b2c-9ae5-e7616156aeff.png">
